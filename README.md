In Python, the __init__.py files are what turn a regular directory into a "package" that you can import from.

Their main purpose is to signal to Python that the directory isn't just a folder of files, but a module that can be bundled and referenced.

How They Work in That Structure
Making src the Main Package:

The file src/__init__.py tells Python that the entire src directory is a package.

This is what allows your main.py or Dockerfile to run your code as a module and lets you do clean imports.

Creating Sub-packages:

src/agents/__init__.py makes the agents folder a "sub-package" of src.

src/tools/__init__.py makes the tools folder a "sub-package" of src.

The Practical Benefit: Clean Imports
Because these files exist, you can write clean, explicit import statements from anywhere in your project.

For example, inside your src/agents/research_agent.py file, you can now write:

Python

# This works *because* of the __init__.py files
from src.tools.web_search import get_search_tool
from src.prompts.loader import load_prompt  # A function you might write
Without the __init__.py files, Python would give you an ImportError because it wouldn't know how to "find" the src.tools module.
