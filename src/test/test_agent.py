# test_tools.py: It's very easy to write unit tests for your tools.
# You can run test_web_search.py to make sure your search tool works without having to run your entire agent.

# test_agents.py: This is more complex, but you can write tests that check if your agent selects the correct tool 
# given a specific input, often by using a mocked (fake) LLM.
